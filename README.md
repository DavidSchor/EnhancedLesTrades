This userscript is made by taking a subset of https://github.com/Revadike/EnhancedBarter (the gg deals parts and parts of the readme ;) and expanding on those and adapting them to Lestrades.

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)
2. Install [Enhanced Lestrades](https://github.com/DavidSchor/EnhancedLestrades/raw/main/EnhancedLestrades.user.js)
3. Enjoy!

Thank you to Revadike for all his work on Enhanced Barter that I have then cherry picked from <3
